This application is a demonstration of the use of the soon-to-be-released 
delightful_forms plugin for Rails.  

The plugin, and this demonstration application are contributed to the community
by my employer: ShopKeep.com.  The initial extraction of code from our business 
application is complete.  I am in the process of now 'paring it down' to a 
bare-bones Rails application.  When that is complete, I'll be moving on to the 
central task of moving the work currently done by the shared/stretchy_text_field
partial into a FormBuilder.

Feel free to contact me at the email address below with comments, criticisms, or
suggestions... or even offers of help! ;-)
